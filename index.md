## About Me

I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at Criteo and CNRS-ISIR, Sorbonne University, under the direction of [**Patrick Gallinari**](https://pages.isir.upmc.fr/gallinari/) and [**Alberto Lumbreras**](https://albertolumbreras.net/). 

My PhD research revolves around the design of models that can generate text from structured data, such as tables or knowledge graphs. Lately, I have been working on the development of efficient architectures. I am also interested in large language models and their applications to various NLP tasks.

## Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing:** large language models, efficient architectures, data-to-text generation.
